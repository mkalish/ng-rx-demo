# Who am I?

- Senior software engineer at Learning Objects

- We build cool things to help transform the eduction sector

---

# What are Reactive Extensions?

1. A new hair product

2. The latest SNL sketch

3. A new programming paradigm

# None of the above (sort of)!

It is a programming paradigm, but it's actually not that new

---

# Microsoft first announced Reactive extensions for .NET and Silverlight in 2009

> At the heart of the library are two new interfaces `IObservable<T> and IObserver<T>`. The Rx library provides API create instances of these interfaces from scratch, convert existing asynchronous patterns such as events to these interfaces, query, transform and merge observables. All together creating a new powerful way of writing asynchronous applications.

[Introduction Post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rxteam/archive/2009/11/17/announcing-reactive-extensions-rx-for-net-silverlight.aspx)

---

# The project was open sourced in 2012

- ## A lot was included on top of the .NET version.  Microsoft also released RxJS and Rx++
- ## Since then versions have been released for Java, Ruby and Python
- ## [Home of RX](https://rx.codeplex.com/)

---

# Why now?
## Properly handling asynchronous flows is a major key to responsive and clean UIs

---

# Really, its actually older than 2009

At its core, Reactive Extensions is an implementation of the *Observer pattern* with a lot of synatic sugar on top of it.

---

# Gang of four

> The observer pattern is a design pattern that defines a link between objects so that when one object's state changes, all dependent objects are updated automatically. This pattern allows communication between objects in a loosely coupled manner.

---

# Extension of observer pattern
- ## Two key enhancements
    1. Ability for an observer to signal when there is no more data (completed)
    2. Ability for an observer to signal when an error has ocurred
- ## All updates are pushed rather than pulled (different from arrays)

---

# Key features of Reactive Extensions

- ## Unopiniated
- ## Declarative
- ## Composable

# Properties of Observables

---

# Simple API

```javascript
    let simple = Rx.Observable.from([1,2,3]);
    simple.subscribe(
        (next) => {
            console.log(next); // onNext event
        },
        () => {
            console.log('ERROR'); // onError event
        },
        () => {
            console.log('DONE'); // onComplete event
        }
    );

    // 1
    // 2
    // 3
    // DONE
```
---

# Creating an observable
```javascript
    Rx.Observable.create((observer) => {
        var x = 0;
        while(x <= 2) {
            observer.onNext(x);
            x++;
        }
        observer.onCompleted();
    })
    .subscribe(
        (val) => {console.log(val)},
        null
        () => {console.log('COMPLETE')}
    );
    // 0
    // 1
    // 2
    // COMPLETE
```

---

# Streams are lazy (normally)

```javascript
    let interval = Rx.Observable.interval(500)
        .map(() => { console.log('TICK'); });
    // Never fires until we have a subscription

    interval.subscribe(
        () => {
            console.log('NEXT');
        },
        null,
        () => {
            console.log('COMPLETE');
        }
    );

    // TICK
    // NEXT
    // TICK
    // NEXT
    // COMPLETE
```
---

# Streams are immutable
```javascript
    let observable = Rx.Observable.from([0, 1, 2]);
    let filteredObservable = observable.filter((value) => { return value !== 1; });

    observable.subscribe(
        (value) => { console.log(value); },
        null,
        () => {
            console.log('COMPLETE');
        }
    );
    filteredObservable.subscribe(
            (value) => { console.log(value); },
            null,
            () => { console.log('COMPLETE'); }
        );
    // 0
    // 0
    // 1
    // 2
    // 2
    // COMPLETE
    // COMPLETE
```

---

# Streams are composable
```javascript
    let zeroToFour = Rx.Observable.from([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]);
    let abc = Rx.Observable.from(['a', 'b', 'c']);

    let merged = zeroToFour
        .merge(abc)
        .filter((value) => {
            return value !== 2 && value !== 'c';
        })
        .subscribe(
            (value) =>{
                console.log(value)
            },
            null,
            () => {
                console.log('COMPLETE');
            }
        );

        // 0
        // a
        // 1
        // b
        // 3
        // 4
        // COMPLETE
```

---

# Streams can emit streams

```javascript
    let issues = Rx.Observable
        .from(['open', 'closed'])
        .map((state) => {
            return Rx.Observable.
                fromPromise(
                    fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/Reactive-Extensions/rxjs/issues?state=${state}`)
                );
        })
        .flatMapLatest((response) => {
            return response.data;
        });

    issues.subscribe((issuesList) => {
        renderToDOM(issuesList);
    });
```

---

# Angular and RxJS
- ## Very small API footprint
- ## Most of the work is handled by the injectable rx service
- ## Specific angular integration is handled by extensions on $rootScope
- ## The $rootScope integration works, but its not necessarily concise

---

# Factories
- ## rx : Contains all the functionality of RxJS
- ## observeOnScope : factory to create streams based on changes on scope

---

# Angular specific methods on observables
- safeApply : makes sure $scope.$apply is called after an emitted value

- safeDigest : makes sure $scope.$digest is called after an emitted value

```javascript
    rx.Observable.from([0, 1, 2])
        .filter((value) => {
            return value === 2
        })
        .safeApply(() => {
            this,
            (value) => {
                this.value = value;
            }
        })
        .subscribe();
```
- identical to using the `do()` operator
---

# Methods added to $rootScope (and inherited down)
- ## $createObservableFunction
- ## $digestObservables
- ## $eventToObservable
- ## $toObservable

# The hardest part is to think Reactive

---

# Code Demo
Lets build a simple (aka barely functional) game of pong

---

# Why RxJS?
- Language agnostic (same thought process transfers ro RxJava and Rx++)

- Works gracefully with the DOM

- Pipeline is composable and therefore very testable

- Supports ES2015 specs including Promises and Generators

- Schedulers provide a greater degree of flexiblity in how you handle concurrency

- Concise handling of observable cleanup
